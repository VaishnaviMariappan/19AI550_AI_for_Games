#### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221240058
### AIM: 
The aim of the game is to shoot and pop balloons for points, preventing them from reaching the bottom. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score.

### ALGORITHM:


Hereâ€™s an algorithm outlining the steps for this "Balloon Shooter" game implemented using Tkinter:

1. **Initialize Game Settings and UI Elements:**
   - Set up the game window dimensions and properties (width, height, and title).
   - Create a canvas to represent the game background and set the sky-blue background color.
   - Define game settings such as balloon colors, sizes, speeds, cannon dimensions, bullet properties, and the initial score.

2. **Create and Position the Cannon:**
   - Calculate the initial position of the cannon at the bottom center of the canvas.
   - Draw the cannon as a rectangle and store its canvas ID.

3. **Define Game Functions:**
   
   - **Create Balloons (`create_balloon`):**
     - Randomly choose a horizontal starting position and color for each balloon.
     - Randomly assign each balloon a horizontal movement direction.
     - Draw the balloon at the top of the canvas.
     - Schedule balloon creation at regular intervals (2 seconds).

   - **Move Balloons (`move_balloons`):**
     - Move each balloon down by a set step size.
     - Adjust horizontal movement according to the balloon's direction.
     - Check for boundary conditions to reverse the balloon's direction when it hits the screen edges.
     - If a balloon reaches the bottom of the screen, trigger the game over condition.

   - **Shoot Bullet (`shoot_bullet`):**
     - When the space bar is pressed, create a bullet at the current cannon position.
     - Add the bullet to the bullets list for movement and collision checks.

   - **Move Bullets (`move_bullets`):**
     - Move each bullet upward at a fixed speed.
     - Delete bullets that go off-screen.
     - For each bullet, check for collisions with balloons:
       - If a collision is detected, remove the bullet and balloon, update the score, and display the updated score.

   - **Collision Detection (`check_collision`):**
     - Check if a bullet's position overlaps with a balloon's position, indicating a collision.

   - **Move Cannon Left and Right (`move_left`, `move_right`):**
     - Move the cannon left or right based on arrow key presses, ensuring it stays within canvas boundaries.

   - **Game Over (`game_over`):**
     - Stop balloon and bullet movement by disabling game activity.
     - Display a message box with the final score and close the game window.

4. **Event Bindings and Game Loop:**
   - Bind the space bar to the `shoot_bullet` function.
   - Bind left and right arrow keys to move the cannon.
   - Start a loop to create and move balloons and bullets at set intervals to animate the game elements.

5. **Run the Game:**
   - Start the Tkinter main loop to display the game window and handle user interactions continuously.

This algorithm structures the game mechanics, animation, and player interactions, allowing for smooth gameplay.
